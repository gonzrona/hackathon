## 2D_Program

### solver_functions

The directory solver_functions contains two files, server.c and DST.c. These two files contain the solver that we will focus on in the Hackathon.

We store the matrices as 1D arrays:

Matrix:
[ a_{1,1}  a_{1,2}  a_{1,3}
  a_{2,1}  a_{2,2}  a_{2,3}
  a_{3,1}  a_{3,2}  a_{3,3} ]
  
  1D array:
  [ a_{1,1}  a_{1,2}  a_{1,3} a_{2,1}  a_{2,2}  a_{2,3} a_{3,1}  a_{3,2}  a_{3,3} ]
